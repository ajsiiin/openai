Using different GPT-based LLM agents to manage distinct parts of the request processing and automation workflow is a powerful approach. Each agent can specialize in one function (such as classification, query generation, validation, or response generation), enabling a modular and scalable architecture. Here’s a suggested design where each LLM agent operates on specific components in the backend:

### **Overview of Multi-Agent System**

1. **Request Classification Agent**: Classifies the incoming Ops request.
2. **SQL Query Drafting Agent**: Constructs SQL queries based on classified request type and database structure.
3. **Query Validation Agent**: Validates the generated SQL query for security, efficiency, and accuracy.
4. **Response Formatting Agent**: Formats and contextualizes the final response for Ops, making it user-friendly and complete.

Each agent is a separate component with its own dedicated prompt engineering, ensuring that each function operates optimally. Here’s how to set it up:

---

### **1. Request Classification Agent**

**Purpose**: Identifies the type of request and determines whether it’s related to data issues, trade failures, report generation, etc.

**Implementation**:
- Use this agent to analyze the Ops request and return a high-level classification, such as `Data Issue`, `Trade Failure`, or `Report Generation`.
- This agent can refine classifications with subcategories to ensure the right SQL query logic is followed in the next step.

```python
import openai

def classify_request(description):
    prompt = f"Classify the following request:\n\n'{description}'\n\nThe categories are: Data Issue, Trade Failure, Report Generation."
    
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=20
    )
    classification = response.choices[0].text.strip()
    
    return classification
```

---

### **2. SQL Query Drafting Agent**

**Purpose**: Given the classification and any relevant parameters, this agent drafts an SQL query to fulfill the Ops request.

**Implementation**:
- Use the request classification and additional information (e.g., table structures and columns) to guide this agent in generating the appropriate SQL query.
- This agent should be context-aware of the database schema, which can be dynamically injected into its prompt.

```python
def generate_sql_query(classification, parameters, schema_info):
    prompt = f"""
    You are generating an SQL query for a {classification} request. 
    Based on the following schema information:
    
    {schema_info}
    
    Generate an SQL query to retrieve the relevant data for the request, using the provided parameters: {parameters}.
    """
    
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=100
    )
    sql_query = response.choices[0].text.strip()
    
    return sql_query
```

---

### **3. Query Validation Agent**

**Purpose**: Ensures that the generated SQL query is secure, efficient, and correctly formatted. This agent verifies the structure and logic of the query to avoid issues like SQL injection or performance bottlenecks.

**Implementation**:
- The agent reviews the generated SQL for potential security risks and syntax accuracy.
- It can also add limiters, such as `TOP` or pagination clauses, if needed.

```python
def validate_sql_query(sql_query):
    prompt = f"""
    Validate the following SQL query for security and efficiency:
    
    {sql_query}
    
    Ensure there are no security risks, and check if any optimizations (like LIMIT or pagination) are necessary.
    """
    
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=50
    )
    
    validation_feedback = response.choices[0].text.strip()
    return validation_feedback
```

---

### **4. Response Formatting Agent**

**Purpose**: Takes the raw data result from the database and formats it into a clear, well-structured response for the Ops team.

**Implementation**:
- This agent interprets the SQL output and creates a concise summary or visual representation if necessary.
- It ensures that the response is actionable, answering the Ops team’s question directly and explaining any relevant details or patterns.

```python
def format_response(raw_data, classification):
    prompt = f"""
    You are formatting the following raw data for an Ops team based on a {classification} request:
    
    Data: {raw_data}
    
    Summarize the data, highlight any important insights, and structure the response so it’s easy for non-technical users to understand.
    """
    
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=150
    )
    
    formatted_response = response.choices[0].text.strip()
    return formatted_response
```

---

### **Putting It All Together**

Here’s a possible flow that connects all these agents in a cohesive backend pipeline:

1. **Request Intake**: The system receives a request from the Ops team.
2. **Classification Agent**: The `classify_request` function classifies the Ops request.
3. **SQL Query Drafting Agent**: Based on the classification and any user-provided parameters, the `generate_sql_query` function creates an SQL query.
4. **Query Validation Agent**: The `validate_sql_query` function checks the query for safety and efficiency.
5. **Query Execution**: If validation passes, the query is executed against the database.
6. **Response Formatting Agent**: The `format_response` function formats the raw data output for clarity and readability.

---

### **Sample End-to-End Workflow in Code**

Here’s a simplified example combining all agents:

```python
# Step 1: Classify the request
classification = classify_request("Retrieve all failed trades from the last month.")

# Step 2: Draft the SQL query
parameters = {"date_range": "last month"}
schema_info = "trades (trade_id, status, trade_date, amount, user_id)"  # Simplified schema example
sql_query = generate_sql_query(classification, parameters, schema_info)

# Step 3: Validate the SQL query
validation_feedback = validate_sql_query(sql_query)
if "Unsafe" in validation_feedback:
    raise ValueError("SQL query validation failed.")

# Step 4: Execute the SQL query (skipping actual DB connection for brevity)
# Assuming `execute_sql` is a function that runs the query and returns results
raw_data = execute_sql(sql_query)

# Step 5: Format the response for the Ops team
formatted_response = format_response(raw_data, classification)
print(formatted_response)
```

### **Benefits of Multi-Agent System**

- **Modularity**: Each agent specializes in a single task, improving the accuracy and scalability of the entire system.
- **Error Handling and Debugging**: Errors can be traced to a specific agent, making debugging easier.
- **Flexibility for Improvements**: You can fine-tune each agent independently (e.g., use a more powerful model for SQL validation if security is critical).
- **Efficiency in Resource Usage**: Each agent can use a different model or configuration, optimizing costs (e.g., classification may need less computational power than query generation).

This setup will allow for a streamlined, accurate, and scalable solution, with LLMs driving automation across multiple parts of the workflow.
